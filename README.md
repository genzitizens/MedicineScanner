**A low-cost, centralized medicine inventory system for Doctors on Ground (DnG)**

## 🚑 About

**Doctors on Ground (DnG)** is a healthcare-focused NGO operating across various locations to deliver essential medical care. One of their core logistical challenges is efficiently managing medicine inventory - especially tracking inventory, expiry dates and ensuring timely disposal.

Currently, this process is entirely **manual**, leading to:

- Disconnected databases across sites  
- Higher risk of expired or mismanaged medicines  
- Increased administrative burden  
- No centralized visibility over inventory  

## ❗ Problem Statement

- 🔄 Manual data entry is inefficient and error-prone  
- 🏥 Each site uses an independent, uncoordinated system  
- 📦 Expired medicines are not always removed promptly  
- 💸 Barcode scanners are costly and difficult to scale across locations  
- 🌐 Online database services often require paid subscriptions at scale  

## 💡 Our Solution

**MedicineScanner** aims to build a **centralized, low-cost** medicine tracking system by:

- 📱 Using smartphone cameras to scan medicine barcodes, avoiding the need for expensive hardware  
- ☁️ Creating a **free, unified online database** accessible across all field sites  
- 📊 Offering a simple, intuitive interface for logging, querying, and monitoring medicine stock and expiry dates  
- 🔒 Enabling secure, accurate, and real-time data synchronization  
- ⏰ Sending reminders for medicines that are near or past their expiry dates

## 🔧 Tech Goals

- Keep the system free and maintainable  
- Enable quick data entry using smartphone barcode scanning  
- Offer web-based or lightweight mobile access for remote clinics  
- Allow alerts for soon-to-expire or recalled medications  

## 🤝 Impact

- Saves time and resources for healthcare workers  
- Reduces waste due to expired medication  
- Improves patient safety and supply chain visibility  
- Enables better coordination across DnG’s medical outreach network
